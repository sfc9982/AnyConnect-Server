## !!! ⚠️ Warning For People in Iran: 🇮🇷 !!!

Although SSLVPN encrypts its traffic.

Cisco's AnyConnect protocol is **VERY EASY to be DETECTED by your government**.

So if you are a democracy fighter or some stuff like that, **DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT**!!!

(Better run to USA XD)

**(And for those CTOs using my project, I really want a H1B or immigration opportunities, thank you)**

```bash
wget -N --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfc9982/AnyConnect-Server/main/ocserv.sh
